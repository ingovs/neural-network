# Neural Network From Scratch
This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network built entirely from scratch using only Python and fundamental libraries (like NumPy). The goal of this project is learning and understanding the core concepts behind neural networks—such as forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient descent, and activation functions—without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks.

It is meant as an educational project to deepen my understanding of how neural networks work under the hood.
